# DD Service: Hierarchical LLM Agent System for Commercial Due Diligence

A research project exploring hierarchical, role-specialized teams of LLM-based agents for generating commercial due diligence (DD) reports.

## Project Overview

This system implements a structured approach to commercial due diligence using hierarchical LLM agents that mirror real-world management consulting workflows. The agents are organized in a Partner → Manager → Analyst hierarchy, incorporating human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback for enhanced accuracy and quality.

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Agent Structure**: Role-specialized agents working in a coordinated manner
- **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieval-augmented generation for improved factual accuracy
- **Numerical Reasoning**: Capabilities for market sizing and financial analysis
- **HITL Integration**: Human feedback loops for quality assurance and accuracy
- **LLM as a judge**: LLM as a judge to rate the quality of outputs

## Research Goals

The project aims to evaluate whether structured agent orchestration and HITL feedback result in:
- Higher factual accuracy in DD reports
- Better risk identification
- Improved narrative coherence
- Superior outcomes compared to single-agent or flat multi-agent systems
